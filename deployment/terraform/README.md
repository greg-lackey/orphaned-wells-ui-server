# Terraform deployment for orphaned-wells-ui-server

This directory contains the Terraform configuration used to manage backend VM infrastructure for OGRRE collaborators.

## What is included

- `main.tf` defines a `local.collaborators` map and creates a backend VM module for each entry.
- `modules/backend_vm` contains the reusable VM module, including a compute instance, static IP, and DNS record.
- `variables.tf` declares the Terraform input variables.
- `terraform.tfvars` provides the default Google Cloud project and region values.
- `scripts/import_backend_vms.sh` imports existing GCP instances, static IPs, and DNS records into Terraform state.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed (compatible with Terraform 1.x)
- Google Cloud SDK installed
- Access to the target GCP project for this deployment
- A supported shell to run `bash` scripts

## Google Cloud login

From this directory, authenticate to Google Cloud and set the project that matches your Terraform configuration:

```bash
cd orphaned-wells-ui-server/deployment/terraform

gcloud auth login

gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

gcloud auth application-default login
```

The import script also unsets `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_AUTHORIZED_USER_CREDENTIALS`, and `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_CREDENTIAL_FILE_OVERRIDE` to avoid conflicts with existing credentials.

## Terraform commands

Initialize the working directory and download providers:

```bash
terraform init
```

Create an execution plan with the configured variables:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Apply the planned changes:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

If you need to destroy infrastructure, run:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

> Note: this repository currently uses local state by default (`terraform.tfstate`). Do not delete or lose this file unless you intend to recreate the infrastructure.

## Workspaces

Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple state files for the same configuration. This is useful for separating environments (e.g., staging, production) or testing changes.

List all workspaces:

```bash
terraform workspace list
```

Create a new workspace:

```bash
terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
```

Switch to a workspace:

```bash
terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
```

Show the currently active workspace:

```bash
terraform workspace show
```

Each workspace maintains its own state file and can have different variable values. When you switch workspaces, Terraform loads the associated state.

## Targeting specific modules or resources

To plan or apply changes to only a specific module, use the `-target` flag. This is useful when testing changes to one collaborator's infrastructure without affecting others.

Plan changes for a specific collaborator module:

```bash
terraform plan -target="module.backend_vms[\"staging\"]" -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Apply changes for a specific collaborator module:

```bash
terraform apply -target="module.backend_vms[\"staging\"]" -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

You can also target individual resources within a module:

```bash
terraform plan -target="module.backend_vms[\"staging\"].google_compute_instance.vm" -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

> Caution: using `-target` modifies state tracking and should only be used for specific, isolated changes. Always review the plan output carefully before applying.

## Import existing infrastructure into Terraform state

The import script is designed to import existing backend VM resources for collaborators that already exist in Google Cloud.

```bash
bash scripts/import_backend_vms.sh
```

This script imports:

- the Compute Engine instance
- the reserved static IP address
- the DNS record in the `uow-carbon-org` managed zone

### Updating the import script for a new collaborator

If you add a collaborator, also update `scripts/import_backend_vms.sh`:

- add the collaborator key to the `COLLABORATORS` array
- add the collaborator zone mapping to the `ZONES` associative array

For example:

```bash
declare -A ZONES=(
  [isgs]="us-central1-a"
  [osage]="us-central1-f"
  [ca]="us-central1-f"
  [newts]="us-central1-b"
  [staging]="us-central1-a"
  [boots]="us-central1-a"
)

COLLABORATORS=("isgs" "osage" "ca" "newts" "staging" "boots")
```

Then rerun the import script.

## Adding a new collaborator

To add a new collaborator VM, update the `local.collaborators` map in `main.tf`.

Example collaborator block:

```hcl
locals {
  collaborators = {
    boots = {
      enable_startup_script  = false
      zone                   = "us-central1-a"
      machine_type           = "e2-standard-2"
      boot_image             = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-12-bookworm-v20260513"
      boot_disk_size         = 20
      boot_resource_policies = []
      boot_disk_device_name  = "boots-uow-server"
    }

    # existing collaborators...
  }
}
```

After updating `main.tf`, run:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

If the new VM already exists in the GCP project, also add it to `scripts/import_backend_vms.sh` and run the script to import the resources into state.

## Notes

- `main.tf` uses a `for_each` loop to instantiate the `backend_vm` module for each collaborator.
- The module creates a compute instance, reserved static IP address, and DNS record in `uow-carbon-org`.
- Each managed resource uses `prevent_destroy = true` to protect production infrastructure from accidental deletion.
- Keep `terraform.tfvars` updated if the project or region changes.
